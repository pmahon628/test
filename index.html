<P>Hello, my name is Patrick Mahon.  In case you were wondering, that is not me, but a picture of a golden retreiver puppy.<br><br>I want to tell you about who I am and what I am about. I was born in Oklahoma City in 1990. I have a younger brother an older sister
and a mom and dad.  Shortly after I was born, the family moved on over to Manchester, New Hampshire where I was rasied.  Growing up I enjoyed playing sports including
baseball, socccer, swimming, football, badmitton, and eventaully in high school I found my favorite sport, rowing.<br><br> I also like to play music and I have played trumpet, 
bass guitar (upright and electric) but now I just play acoustic guitar when I have time.  Sticking with the theme of music, I love listening to music and going to concerts.
I started with classic rock with bands such as Led Zeppelin, Aerosmith, and AC/DC and then moved around to heavy metal with Metallica, Motley Crue and Iron Maiden.
Since then my taste has changed to include many artists ranging from the jam band Umphrey's Mcgee, the rapper Anderson Paak., funk duo Chromeo and the jazz rock greats, Steely Dan.<br><br>
I went to college in two places, first I was in Florida at Jacksonville University in Florida. I went there since I got a scholarship to row, and I felt the need to get away
after living in Manchester my whole life.  My year down there was a alot of fun, I made great friends, traveled to Georgia, Tennessee, all over Florida and learned what it meant
to be somewhere that did not have winter.  However, I felt the pull of New England call to me and I knew I could not stay.  After a year I transfered to the University
of New Hampshire and I graduated from there in 2013.</P>
<P>These days I can found living in Newmarket, with my wife Caitlin, my golden retreiver Walter and my son Jack.  Though I majored in history during college, I am now
    learning to write code to be a web developer.  It is absoutely fascinating field and the ability to see how web pages are put together and the nuts and bolts behind the
    "curtain" of the internet.
    </P>
